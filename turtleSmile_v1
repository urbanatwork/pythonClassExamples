This was quickly done before class but please follow these directions

Please add the following:
    1. draw head and color it yellow
    2. use a for loop to draw one or more of the elements
    3. include user input to make the smile get bigger
    4. add inside and outer parts to the eye (see example)

Example:

#draw outter eye
turtle.pendown()
turtle.circle(50,360)
